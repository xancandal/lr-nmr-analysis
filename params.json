An example of the results is given in the figures below, which represent the results of simulations using L1 and L2 regularization (CO), just L2 regularization (L2), and the original signal (SG). \r\n\r\n![t2_pdco](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xancandal/lr-nmr-analysis/master/t2_pdco.png)\r\n![residuals](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xancandal/lr-nmr-analysis/master/residuals.png)\r\n![decay](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xancandal/lr-nmr-analysis/master/decay.png)\r\n![components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xancandal/lr-nmr-analysis/master/components.png)\r\n","google":"UA-65464406-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
