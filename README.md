# Analysis of data from low-resolution NMR relaxometry

In this work, we apply advanced sparse representation tools to the problem of LR-NMR relaxometry. 

What can it do?
------
It provides a tool for processing, analysing, and inspecting Low-Resolution Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Relaxometry data, due to its capability of solving the Laplace Inverse problem using Numerical Optimization Methods in Matlab.

How does it work?
------
We use a primal-dual interior method for convex objectives which can be adjusted to solve the LR-NMR relaxometry inverse problem with non-negativity constraints and an L1 regularization term that stabilizes the solution process without introducing the typical L2 peak broadening.
